# ðŸ“Š E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis using Power BI

## Project Overview  
E-commerce businesses generate huge volumes of sales data, but turning that raw information into actionable insights is often challenging. This project leverages **Power BI** to transform Flipkartâ€™s sales dataset into an interactive dashboard that highlights key business metrics. The analysis provides visibility into **orders, product performance, customer behavior, profitability, and forecasting**, enabling data-driven decisions to improve pricing, marketing strategies, and overall business growth.  

## Data Source

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI** (data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations, dashboard creation)  
- **Excel** (source dataset, initial inspection)  

## Steps Performed  
1. Data loading and inspection from Excel source.  
2. Handling missing values and removing empty rows.  
3. Data cleaning and formatting for consistency.  
4. Converting raw data into structured tables.  
5. Building schema relationships between tables.  
6. Creating **DAX measures** for KPIs (Sales, Profit, YoY Growth, Avg. Order Value, etc.).  
7. Designing dashboards using Power BI visuals.  
8. Preparing report documentation and screenshots.
